Hi, My name is Pedram Keshavarzi

I started programming since the age of 13. I tried many branches of it and lastly chosen web developing, because i see it as a beautiful combination of art and programming. I worked as a freelancer through highschool and was in different teams and projects. Since I graduated highschool i chose developing as a profession and tried to update my self daily to the edge of technology. I recently created a javascript framework called Selph. And I hope one day I can bcome a successful CTO!
